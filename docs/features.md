# pi-vimmode feature guide

pi-vimmode replaces Pi's main prompt editor with a Vim-style modal editor. It targets fast prompt editing inside Pi, not full Vim or Neovim parity.

Use this guide for behavior. Use [`settings.md`](https://github.com/pekochan069/pi-vimmode/blob/main/docs/settings.md) for every `piVimMode` setting and default.

## Activation and lifecycle

Pi discovers this extension through `package.json` and installs `VimEditor` as the active `CustomEditor`.

Runtime behavior:

- Installs automatically on `session_start`, `resources_discover`, and `agent_end`.
- Re-runs installation on the next tick for startup/resource timing reliability.
- Registers `/vimmode [on|off|toggle|status]` to temporarily enable/disable the modal editor without uninstalling the extension.
- Loads settings from global and project Pi settings whenever it installs.
- Shows status key `pi-vimmode` as `vim` when settings parse cleanly.
- Shows `vim ⚠` when settings load with warnings.
- Shows `vim off` when disabled through `/vimmode off`.
- Keeps `bar` hardware cursors visible while Pi agent work is active, suppresses non-bar hardware cursors, and resets terminal cursor hints on `session_shutdown` or `/vimmode off`.

Example install from Git:

```sh
pi install git:https://github.com/pekochan069/pi-vimmode
```

Local development:

```sh
bun install
bun test
```

## Disable or recover

Because pi-vimmode replaces Pi's main prompt editor, keep the recovery path handy when trying it in a new terminal.

- Run `/vimmode off` to restore Pi's previous editor for the current extension runtime.
- Run `/vimmode on` or `/vimmode` to enable the Vim editor again.
- Run `pi list` to confirm the installed extension source.
- Run `pi remove <source>` or `pi uninstall <source>` to remove it from Pi settings.
- For the Git install shown above, run `pi remove git:https://github.com/pekochan069/pi-vimmode`.
- Restart Pi or start a new session so extension discovery reloads without pi-vimmode.
- Run `pi config` if you want to enable/disable package resources through Pi's TUI instead of hand-editing settings.
- If the terminal cursor shape looks stuck, close and reopen the terminal. pi-vimmode resets tracked cursor styles on `session_shutdown`, but terminal support is best effort.

## Modes

| Mode         | Label     | Purpose                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insert       | `INSERT`  | Normal Pi text entry. Printable input inserts text. Pi autocomplete, submit, image paste, external editor, and app shortcuts stay available. |
| Normal       | `NORMAL`  | Vim command mode. Printable keys run supported Vim actions or are ignored.                                                                   |
| Visual char  | `VISUAL`  | Characterwise selection. Selection is highlighted inline.                                                                                    |
| Visual line  | `V-LINE`  | Linewise selection. Whole selected lines are highlighted.                                                                                    |
| Visual block | `V-BLOCK` | Rectangular selection. Selected cells are highlighted.                                                                                       |

Startup mode is `insert` by default. Configure `piVimMode.startMode` to start new prompts in `normal` instead.

## Quick reference

pi-vimmode has a finite prompt-local surface. This quickref classifies what is supported; it is not a Vim/Neovim quickref clone.

Diagnostic/help metadata IDs are for discovery only: `vimmode.doctor`, `vimmode.actions`, `vimmode.keymap`, `vimmode.keybindings`, `vimmode.mapcheck`, `vimmode.help`, `vimmode.features`, `vimmode.messages`, and `vimmode.inspect` are not accepted by `piVimMode.keymap.actions` and cannot dispatch from user keybindings. Use `piVimMode.keymap.commands.showKeybindings` for an optional normal-mode shortcut to the keybindings popup. Use canonical `prompt.transform.*` IDs for prompt transform keybindings and diagnostic queries.

Non-goals: no public plugin action API, diagnostic action keybinding dispatch, runtime `:map`, runtime `:action`, Vimscript, Neovim Lua, full Vim help tags, help pager, or broad quickref parity.

### Escape and reset behavior

- Insert + inactive autocomplete: `Esc` enters normal mode.
- Insert + active autocomplete: `Esc` delegates to Pi so autocomplete can close.
- Optional `piVimMode.keymap.escape` aliases such as `<D-j>` or `<C-j>` enter normal mode from insert mode when autocomplete is inactive, cancel visual modes, and cancel pending `:` Ex command-lines.
- Raw printable text chords such as `jk` or `jj` are rejected; aliases are real key sequences, not inserted text.
- Escape aliases are disabled while autocomplete is open and delegate to Pi instead.
- Normal: `Esc` delegates to Pi so interrupt/abort behavior still works.
- Visual modes: `Esc` and configured escape aliases cancel selection and return to normal mode.
- In normal/visual prompt editing, `Enter`, `Ctrl-C`, and `Ctrl-G` reset Vim transient state, return to configured startup mode, and delegate to Pi.
- While `/` search or `:` Ex command-line is pending, `Enter` completes or executes that pending operation instead; `Ctrl-C` and `Ctrl-G` reset/delegate.
- In insert mode, non-`Esc` keys delegate to Pi unless they are part of configured `piVimMode.keymap.escape` handling or configured `piVimMode.keymap.insert` newline, edit, or movement bindings.
- Configured insert newline bindings (`piVimMode.keymap.insert.openLineBelow` / `openLineAbove`) open a blank line above or below the current prompt line while staying in insert mode. They only work when Pi autocomplete is inactive; autocomplete-active input keeps Pi ownership.
- Configured insert edit bindings (`piVimMode.keymap.insert.deleteWordBackward`, `deleteWordForward`, `deleteLineBackward`, `deleteLineForward`) edit prompt text in insert mode without writing Vim registers, marks, macros, dot-repeat state, or prompt transforms.
- Configured insert movement bindings (`piVimMode.keymap.insert.moveWordBackward`, `moveWordForward`, `moveLineStart`, `moveLineEnd`) move the cursor in insert mode without changing prompt text.
- Insert word movement and deletion reuse pi-vimmode lowercase small-word semantics, where keyword runs, punctuation runs, and whitespace are separate groups.
- `piVimMode.keymap.insert` owns only physical insert edits and movement. Semantic prompt transforms remain under `piVimMode.keymap.actions`.
- Insert bindings are not Vim mappings: no raw printable chords such as `jk`, `jj`, or `oo`, no multi-key insert sequences, no insert abbreviations, no recursive mappings, no `.vimrc`, no Vimscript, no Neovim Lua, no default insert presets, no runtime `:map`, and no runtime `:action`.

### Readline-style and home-row-mod insert binding examples

Readline-style example:

```json
{
  "piVimMode": {
    "keymap": {
      "insert": {
        "deleteWordBackward": ["ctrl+w"],
        "deleteLineBackward": ["ctrl+u"],
        "deleteLineForward": ["ctrl+k"],
        "moveWordBackward": ["alt+b"],
        "moveWordForward": ["alt+f"],
        "moveLineStart": ["ctrl+a"],
        "moveLineEnd": ["ctrl+e"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Home-row-mod example:

```json
{
  "piVimMode": {
    "keymap": {
      "insert": {
        "openLineBelow": ["ctrl+o"],
        "openLineAbove": ["ctrl+k"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`ctrl+k` cannot be assigned to both readline-style `deleteLineForward` and home-row-style `openLineAbove` in the same insert keymap.

- Unknown control/non-printable keys delegate to Pi. Unmapped printable keys in normal/visual mode are ignored.
- `Ctrl-D` and `Ctrl-U` are Vim-owned half-page scroll motions in normal/visual modes, but insert mode still delegates them to Pi/default editing.

Example:

```text
Type prompt text in insert mode
Esc          -> normal mode
0wciwidea    -> move, change inner word, type replacement
<D-j>        -> normal mode again when configured as piVimMode.keymap.escape
Enter        -> submit through Pi
```

## Normal mode motions

<!-- runtime-help:motions -->

| Key                   | Action                                  | Notes                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h` / `j` / `k` / `l` | left / down / up / right                | Counts repeat adapter movement, e.g. `5l`. Arrow keys (Left, Down, Up, Right) are aliases for the same directional motions. |
| `0` / `$`             | line start / line end                   | Current prompt line.                                                                                                        |
| `^` / `_`             | first non-blank on line                 | Both map to same action.                                                                                                    |
| `w` / `b` / `e`       | word forward / word backward / word end | Prompt-local word movement; current behavior remains unchanged.                                                             |
| `W` / `B` / `E`       | WORD forward / backward / end           | Whitespace-delimited WORD tokens, useful for flags and paths.                                                               |
| `ge` / `gE`           | previous word / WORD end                | Move backward to previous word-end or whitespace WORD-end.                                                                  |
| `gg` / `G`            | prompt start / prompt end               | `G` moves to end of last line.                                                                                              |
| `Ctrl-D` / `Ctrl-U`   | half-page down / up                     | Prompt-local line movement; counts multiply the half-page amount.                                                           |
| `%`                   | matching pair                           | Supports `()`, `[]`, `{}` under or after cursor on current line.                                                            |
| `{` / `}`             | paragraph backward / forward            | Blank-line-separated paragraph runs; counts repeat and clamp at prompt bounds.                                              |
| `f{char}` / `F{char}` | find char forward/backward              | Current line only.                                                                                                          |
| `t{char}` / `T{char}` | move until before/after char            | Current line only.                                                                                                          |
| `;` / `,`             | repeat char search                      | Same/opposite direction.                                                                                                    |

Counts work for supported motions: `3w`, `2e`, `2W`, `2gE`, `4j`, `2fx`, `2<C-d>`, `2}`. `Ctrl-D` and `Ctrl-U` clamp safely at prompt bounds and move the cursor so existing rendering reveals the new location.

Paragraph motions are prompt-local and blank-line based. A paragraph is a contiguous run of non-blank lines separated by one or more whitespace-only blank lines. `}` moves to the first column of the next paragraph, or to the prompt end when no later paragraph exists. `{` moves to the current paragraph start, or to the previous paragraph start when already there. They work in normal and visual modes; visual mode keeps the anchor and moves the active cursor. This is smaller than Vim's full paragraph grammar: no nroff macros, sentence motions, section motions, or language-aware paragraph parsing.

Motion limitations: this feature set does not add subword/camelCase navigation, display-line motions such as `gj`/`gk`, full-page scroll keys such as `<C-f>`/`<C-b>`, viewport recentering such as `zz`/`zt`/`zb`, recursive mappings, Vimscript, `.vimrc`, or full Vim/Neovim parity. Lowercase `w`, `b`, and `e` keep their current prompt-local boundary behavior.

Example:

```text
one two three
^   cursor on o
3w  moves to start of third word or as far as prompt allows
%   jumps between matching brackets when cursor is on or before bracket on same line

run --flag=value /tmp/a-b
^ cursor on r
W moves to --flag=value; E moves to the end of that WORD; gE from /tmp/a-b moves back to e
```

## Normal mode edits

| Key                 | Action                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `i`                 | enter insert at cursor                                                  |
| `a`                 | insert after cursor without crossing current logical line               |
| `I` / `A`           | move to line start/end, then insert                                     |
| `o` / `O`           | open blank line below/above, then insert                                |
| `x` / `X`           | delete character under/before cursor                                    |
| `dd` / `cc` / `yy`  | delete/change/yank current line                                         |
| `D` / `C`           | delete/change from cursor through line end                              |
| `Y`                 | yank current line                                                       |
| `J`                 | join current line with next line using one separating space when needed |
| `p` / `P`           | paste after/before cursor or below/above line                           |
| `Ctrl-a` / `Ctrl-x` | increment/decrement signed integer under or after cursor                |
| `~`                 | toggle case under cursor; count toggles span within current line        |
| `r{char}`           | replace character(s) and stay normal                                    |
| `s` / `S`           | substitute character/current line and enter insert                      |
| `.`                 | repeat last supported completed change                                  |
| `u`                 | delegate to Pi native undo                                              |
| `Ctrl-r`            | redo most recent prompt edit undone by normal-mode `u`                  |

Counts work for supported edits:

```text
3x    delete 3 characters under/after cursor
3X    delete 3 characters before cursor
2dd   delete 2 lines
3>>   indent 3 lines from cursor line
2<<   dedent 2 lines from cursor line
5~    toggle case across 5 characters on current line
10<C-a> increment number by 10
```

Dot-repeat is intentionally finite. It repeats supported recorded normal-mode changes such as `x`, `D`, `C`, `Ctrl-a`, `Ctrl-x`, `~`, `r`, `s`, `S`, `dd`, `cc`, `>>`, `<<`, operator motions, operator character-search changes, and text-object changes. It does not replay arbitrary insert-mode text, yanks, macros, Ex substitutions, visual-mode edits, joins, or pastes.

Redo is intentionally prompt-local and linear. `Ctrl-r` restores the latest text/cursor state undone by normal-mode `u`, remains a safe no-op when no redo state exists, survives cursor movement, and clears when a new text edit creates a different branch. pi-vimmode does not implement Vim's undo tree, redo counts, `:redo`, `g-`, or `g+`.

## Operators and operator motions

Supported operators:

- `d` delete
- `c` change, then enter insert
- `y` yank
- `gu` lowercase
- `gU` uppercase
- `g~` toggle case
- `>` indent line-only shift
- `<` dedent line-only shift

Line-only shift examples:

```text
>>   indent current line by two spaces
<<   dedent current line by one tab, two spaces, or one space
3>>  indent current line and next two lines
2<<  dedent current line and next line
```

Supported operator targets:

- motions: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, arrow keys `Left`/`Down`/`Up`/`Right`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `W`, `B`, `E`, `ge`, `gE`, `0`, `^`, `$`, `gg`, `G`, `%`, `{`, `}`
- character search: `f{char}`, `F{char}`, `t{char}`, `T{char}`, `;`, `,` on the current line
- mark jumps: `` `{mark}`` and `'{mark}`
- prompt search: `/query<Enter>`
- text objects listed below

Examples:

```text
dw        delete to next word start
dW        delete to next whitespace-delimited WORD start
dl        delete one character to the right
dj        delete current and next line
dgg       delete through buffer start

guw       lowercase to next word start
gUiw      uppercase inner word
g~g~      toggle current line case
2guw      lowercase two word motions

d}        delete through next paragraph start, including trailing blank separator
c{        change back through paragraph start
y}        yank through next paragraph start
y$        yank through line end
c^        change back to first non-blank
cE        change through the end of the current/next WORD
3dw       delete three word motions
2dge      delete through the second previous word end
df)       delete from cursor through next ) on current line

ygE       yank back through previous WORD end
d2f,      delete through the second next comma on current line
d/foo⏎    delete from cursor through next literal foo match
```

Successful `d`/`c` motion and character-search targets record dot-repeat. Successful normal `gu`/`gU`/`g~` motion, text-object, and doubled line targets also record dot-repeat. Case operators edit text only: they do not write unnamed or named registers and do not enter insert mode. Successful `d`/`c`/`y` character-search targets update `;` and `,` repeat state, and pending operators can use that state with `d;`, `c,`, and matching configured repeat keys. Missing targets and adjacent `t`/`T` empty ranges are safe no-ops that clear the pending operator without changing text, cursor, registers, or repeat state.

Operator targets are smaller than Vim's full grammar. Character-search operator targets are current-line only and use configured semantic `findCharForward`, `findCharBackward`, `tillCharForward`, `tillCharBackward`, `repeatCharSearch`, and `repeatCharSearchReverse` bindings. Case operators support finite motions, text objects, and doubled line forms only; mark, prompt-search, and character-search case targets are unsupported safe no-ops. `Ctrl-D` and `Ctrl-U` are motions, not operator targets; `d<C-d>` and `y<C-u>` are unsupported safe no-ops. Shift operators are line-only in normal mode: arbitrary `>{motion}`, `<{motion}`, `>iw`, `>/query`, and mark-based shift ranges are unsupported safe no-ops. In visual modes, counts before `>` or `<` change shift depth, so `2>` indents selected/touched lines by two levels.

## Text objects

Text objects work after `d`, `c`, or `y`.

| Object                    | Meaning                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `iw` / `aw`               | inner/around whitespace-delimited word      |
| `i'` / `a'`               | inside/around single quotes on current line |
| `i"` / `a"`               | inside/around double quotes on current line |
| `i(` / `a(` / `i)` / `a)` | inside/around parentheses                   |
| `i[` / `a[` / `i]` / `a]` | inside/around brackets                      |
| `i{` / `a{` / `i}` / `a}` | inside/around braces                        |
| `if` / `af`               | inner/around Markdown code fence            |
| `ih` / `ah`               | inner/around Markdown heading section       |
| `il` / `al`               | inner/around Markdown list item             |
| `it` / `at`               | inner/around XML-ish tag                    |
| `ie` / `ae`               | inner/around pasted error block             |
| `ip` / `ap`               | inner/around blank-line paragraph           |

Examples:

```text
diw   delete current word
ci"   change text inside nearest double quotes on current line
da)   delete parenthesized expression including delimiters
ya{   yank braced block including braces
daf   delete whole Markdown code fence
cih   change body of current Markdown heading section
yal   yank current Markdown list item
dip   delete current paragraph body without adjacent blank separators
dap   delete current paragraph plus one adjacent blank separator group
```

Limitations:

- Word objects use whitespace boundaries.
- Quote objects search current line.
- Bracket objects balance delimiters in prompt text, but do not implement Vim's full syntax awareness.
- Prompt-native objects use conservative line-oriented scanning, not full Markdown/XML parsing.
- Paragraph objects use the same blank-line paragraph model as `{` and `}`. `ip` selects the paragraph body only; `ap` adds one adjacent blank separator group when present (following, otherwise preceding) so deleting a paragraph does not leave double blank separators.
- XML-ish tags support matching `<name ...>` / `</name>` pairs and ignore self-closing tags.
- Error block detection is heuristic and stops at blank or unrelated prose lines.

## EasyMotion

EasyMotion is opt-in; it has no default binding. Bind `command.easymotion`, type a target character, then press its label to move the cursor. Matching is case-insensitive and prompt-wide. Up to 52 targets receive deterministic labels: `a` through `z`, then `A` through `Z`.

Labels are render-only substitutions over unchanged prompt cells. Escape, invalid labels, and missing matches leave prompt text and undo/redo history unchanged. Valid labels move the cursor without creating an edit. Configure label color with `piVimMode.easymotion.labelColor`.

## Character search

`f`, `F`, `t`, and `T` search within the current line only. They work as normal-mode motions and as targets after `d`, `c`, or `y`.

Example:

```text
abc_def_ghi
^ cursor on a
f_  -> first underscore
;   -> next underscore
,   -> previous underscore
T_  -> character after previous underscore
```

Search misses are safe no-ops. After operators, `f`/`F` include the matched character in the operated range; `t`/`T` exclude it. Counts target later/earlier matches, e.g. `d2f,` deletes through the second next comma. Adjacent `t`/`T` matches are treated as empty operator ranges and no-op safely.

<!-- runtime-help:search -->

## Prompt search

`/` starts literal forward search in current prompt. `?` starts literal backward search. Type query text, then press `Enter`. `n` repeats last search direction and `N` searches opposite direction. Matches wrap around the prompt.

Examples:

```text
/error⏎     move to next literal error
?error⏎     move to previous literal error
/⏎          recall previous successful query, search forward
?⏎          recall previous successful query, search backward
n           repeat same direction
N           repeat opposite direction
d/error⏎   delete through next literal error match
y?TODO⏎    yank through previous literal TODO match
/\rTODO|FIXME⏎  bounded regex search
```

Word search:

- `*` searches forward for the keyword word under the cursor; `#` searches backward.
- A keyword word is a contiguous run of ASCII letters, digits, and `_`. The cursor on a keyword character uses that containing word; a cursor immediately after a keyword word (including at line end) uses that preceding word.
- `*` and `#` are normal-mode only and reuse prompt search repeat state, so `n` repeats the chosen direction and `N` searches the opposite direction. They share literal matching, wrapping, search history, and search highlighting with `/` and `?`.
- Insert-mode `*` and `#` delegate to Pi default editing.
- Limitations: no `iskeyword` configuration, no regex query generation from the word, no smartcase, no search offsets, and no visual or operator-motion `*` / `#`.

Search workbench behavior:

- `/` and `?` render a width-safe workbench row below the prompt and shrink the prompt viewport by one row while pending.
- `Up` / `Down` navigate prompt-local in-memory search history for the current editor instance.
- Successful searches enter history; misses, invalid regex, and rejected bounded regex patterns do not.
- Empty `/` or `?` recalls the last successful query and matcher mode.
- Search is literal by default. Prefix a pending query with `\r` to opt into bounded JavaScript regex matching.
- Regex search bounds: pattern length 256, prompt text length 50,000 UTF-16 code units, and match-count cap 10,000. Invalid, too-large, or zero-length regex matches are rejected without prompt mutation.

Visual search moves the active cursor while preserving the visual anchor.

Search highlighting:

- Successful `/`, `?`, `n`, and `N` can highlight matches.
- Current match can use distinct styling.
- Highlight rendering is capped by `piVimMode.search.maxHighlights`.
- Precedence is: cursor, visual selection, current search match, other search matches, plain text.
- Search highlight can clear on cancelled search or insert-mode transition depending on settings.

Limitations:

- No search offsets, Vim magic modes, Vim highlight groups, or search across previous prompts.
- Regex mode is bounded mitigation, not a sandboxed regex engine.

## Visual char mode

Enter with `v` from normal mode.

Supported actions:

- Motions extend selection: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `0`, `$`, `^`, `_`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `gg`, `G`, `%`, search, and mark jumps.
- `V` switches to visual line mode without resetting anchor.
- A configured `piVimMode.keymap.commands.visualBlock` binding switches to visual block mode without resetting anchor.
- `y` yanks selection and returns normal.
- `d` / `x` deletes selection and returns normal.
- `c` deletes selection and enters insert.
- `r{char}` replaces selected characters and returns normal.
- `u` lowercases, `U` uppercases, and `~` toggles selected character case; each returns normal without writing registers.
- `>` / `<` indents or dedents every touched line and returns normal.
- `:` opens Ex command-line with `'<,'>` prefilled.
- `"{a-z}` / `"{A-Z}` targets next yank/delete/change with named register.

Example:

```text
vwwy     select roughly two words, yank, return normal
v/foo⏎d  extend to next foo, delete selection
```

## Visual line mode

Enter with `V` from normal mode.

Supported actions:

- Motions extend selected line range.
- `v` switches to visual char mode without resetting anchor.
- A configured `piVimMode.keymap.commands.visualBlock` binding switches to visual block mode without resetting anchor.
- `y`, `d`, `x`, `c`, `r{char}`, `u`, `U`, `~`, `>` / `<`, mark jumps, named register targeting, and `:` work linewise.
- Linewise `p` in visual line mode replaces selected lines with the register content.

Example:

```text
Vj"ay   select two lines and yank into register a
Vjp     replace selected lines with unnamed register
```

## Visual block mode

Enter visual block mode with `piVimMode.keymap.commands.visualBlock`. The default setting is empty because `Ctrl-v`, Windows-style `Alt-v`, and `Ctrl-Alt-v` delegate to Pi for image/clipboard paste in normal and visual modes. Use a non-protected binding such as `<A-b>`, or explicitly allow and bind a paste shortcut if Vim-style visual block is more important than Pi image paste in your workflow.

Supported actions:

- Motions extend rectangular block.
- `v` switches to visual char mode without resetting anchor.
- `V` switches to visual line mode without resetting anchor.
- `y` yanks selected slices joined by newlines.
- `d` / `x` delete selected slices.
- `c` deletes selected slices and enters insert.
- `r{char}` replaces selected cells.
- `u` lowercases, `U` uppercases, and `~` toggles selected cell case without writing registers.
- `>` / `<` indents or dedents every line touched by the block, regardless of selected columns.
- `I` starts block insert before block on each selected line; typed text is applied when `Esc` is pressed.
- `A` starts block append after block on each selected line; typed text is applied when `Esc` is pressed.
- `:` opens Ex command-line with visual line range marker `'<,'>` prefilled.

Example:

```text
Alt-b jj I- Esc
```

Adds `-` before the selected block column on three lines.

## Visual reselection (gv)

From normal mode, `gv` re-enters the last visual selection when available.

- Preserves the previous visual mode: characterwise, linewise, or blockwise.
- Restores the visual anchor and active cursor from the most recent visual exit.
- Safe no-op when no previous selection exists or stored positions are stale after edits.
- Configurable via `piVimMode.keymap.commands.reselectVisual` (default: `gv`).

Example:

```text
vll\x1b  select three characters, escape to normal
gv       reselect the same three characters
```

<!-- runtime-help:ex -->

## Ex command-line

Normal-mode `:` opens a dedicated Ex row below the prompt. Visual `:` opens the same row with `'<,'>` prefilled and keeps the original selection highlighted while editing the command.

Supported commands:

```vim
:       " show command suggestions below the Ex row
:s/old/new/
:%s/old/new/g
:2,4s#old/path#new/path#g
:.,$substitute/old/new/i
:2;.+1s/old/new/g
:'<,'>s/old/new/g
:3             " line jump to line 3
:$             " jump to last line
:2+1           " jump to line 3 (line 2 + offset 1)
:delete      " alias :d
:yank        " alias :y
:put         " alias :pu
:2,4copy$-1  " alias :t
:3,4move0    " alias :m
:join        " alias :j
:nohlsearch " alias :noh
:q            " request Pi shutdown
:quit         " alias :q
:quote
:unquote
:bulletize
:fence ts
:indent
:dedent
:reflow 72
:vimdoctor
:keymap redo
:mapcheck ctrl+p
:actions search
:keybindings
:keybindings redo
:keybindings ctrl+p
:help search
:features nohlsearch
:messages
```

Supported ranges:

- omitted range: current line
- `%`: whole prompt
- `'<,'>`: captured visual range
- numeric line address, e.g. `2`
- `.`: current line
- `$`: last line
- single signed offset on a single-line address, e.g. `.+1`, `$-2`, `3+2`, `3-1`
- comma range, e.g. `2,4`, `.,$`, `$-1,$`
- semicolon range, e.g. `2;.+2`; first address becomes the base for resolving the second address, so `.` in the second address means line 2 here
- normal-mode count before `:`, e.g. `3:` pre-fills a concrete clamped range

Supported destination addresses for `:copy`/`:t` and `:move`/`:m`:

- `0`: before the first prompt line
- numeric line address, e.g. `4`: after that line
- `.`: after current line
- `$`: after last line
- single signed offset on numeric, `.`, or `$` destinations, e.g. `$-1`, `.+1`, `3-1`

Supported substitution flags:

- `g`: replace every non-overlapping match per line
- `i`: case-insensitive match
- `r`: opt into bounded JavaScript regex pattern matching
- `n`: count matches only, report the count, and leave prompt text unchanged
- `e`: suppress the no-match error and report `0 substitutions` instead

Important semantics:

- Pattern matching is literal by default. Add `r` to use bounded regex, e.g. `:%s/TODO|FIXME/done/gr`.
- Replacement text is always literal. `&`, `$1`, and `\1` insert literally, even in regex mode.
- Empty replacement is valid.
- Empty pattern is an error.
- Delimiter can be any printable non-alphanumeric, non-whitespace, non-backslash character.
- `:delete` removes addressed lines and writes the deleted linewise text to the unnamed register.
- `:yank` copies addressed lines to the unnamed register without editing prompt text.
- `:put` inserts unnamed register text as prompt-buffer lines after the addressed range.
- `:delete a` and `:yank a` also write lowercase named register `a` while updating the unnamed register.
- `:delete A` and `:yank A` append to lowercase named register `a` while the unnamed register receives only the latest addressed text.
- `:put a` and `:put A` read lowercase named register `a`; uppercase put reads only and does not append.
- `:copy` duplicates addressed lines after the destination address; destination `0` inserts before line 1.
- `:move` moves addressed lines after the destination address and rejects destinations inside the moved range.
- Destination `0` is only the before-first-line sentinel; offset forms like `0+1` are unsupported.
- `:join` with no explicit range joins current line with next line; explicit ranges join all addressed lines with normalized boundary whitespace.
- `:quote` prefixes addressed lines with Markdown quote syntax `> `.
- `:unquote` removes one leading Markdown quote marker from each addressed quoted line.
- `:bulletize` converts each nonblank addressed line to a Markdown bullet while preserving indentation.
- `:fence [language]` wraps addressed lines in a Markdown code fence with optional language tag.
- `:indent` adds two spaces to each addressed line.
- `:dedent` removes at most one tab, two spaces, or one leading space from each addressed line without deleting content.
- `:reflow [width]` rewraps prose paragraphs to the given width or 80 columns; fenced code, error blocks, blank lines, and bullet lines are preserved.
- `:nohlsearch` clears visible prompt search highlights but keeps repeat-search state for `n`/`N`.
- `:vimdoctor` opens a read-only popup with live customization health, warning count, and first actionable settings warning behind `vim ⚠`.
- `:keymap [query]` opens a read-only popup with effective resolved semantic keymap entries, e.g. `:keymap redo`.
- `:keybindings [query]` opens a read-only popup listing effective bindings by finite category, mode, key, action ID, and description, or showing focused detail for action IDs, descriptions, keys, and protected shortcuts, e.g. `:keybindings redo` or `:keybindings ctrl+p`.
- `:mapcheck <key>` opens a read-only popup explaining mapped, unmapped, protected, or warning-related key ownership, e.g. `:mapcheck ctrl+p`.
- `:actions [query]` opens a read-only popup listing/searching finite supported actions without adding arbitrary Vim grammar.
- `:help [topic]` opens a read-only popup with source-backed runtime help for finite pi-vimmode topics, e.g. `:help search` or `:help ex`.
- `:features [query]` opens a read-only popup listing/searching supported feature areas, commands, actions, limits, and effective runtime state, e.g. `:features nohlsearch` or `:features redo`.
- `:messages` opens a read-only popup with a bounded prompt-local summary of retained recent runtime messages without opening a pager.
- `:changelog` opens packaged current-version release notes as width-safe Markdown in the same read-only popup; it never reads the working directory or network.
- `:q` and `:quit` request graceful Pi shutdown through the Pi extension runtime without editing prompt text, registers, marks, search state, macros, cursor, or dot-repeat.
- `:q!`, `:quit!`, `:wq`, `:x`, `:qa`, `:write`, `:edit`, `:shell`, and other file/window/shell Ex commands are intentionally unsupported.
- `Esc` cancels command-line input. Normal Ex returns to normal mode; visual Ex restores the original visual mode, anchor, cursor, and highlight.
- `Tab` completes a single matching supported Ex command name or extends to the longest shared supported command prefix when multiple suggestions share it. Completion is limited to the command word; command arguments, range completion, Vimscript abbreviation expansion, and menu cycling are intentionally unsupported.
- `Left` / `Right` / `Home` / `End`, forward delete, `Alt-Left`, `Alt-Right`, and `Ctrl-W` edit the pending Ex command text without editing prompt text.
- `Up` / `Down` navigate prompt-local in-memory Ex history for successful commands in the current editor instance and move the command cursor to the end of the recalled command.
- Enter on an empty command closes the Ex row without a message.
- Substitution is two-phase: first `Enter` highlights matched target text and reports a match count without editing, second unchanged `Enter` applies, `Esc` cancels.
- `:&`, `:&&`, and range-qualified forms such as `:%&` repeat the last successfully applied substitution through the same preview/apply flow.
- Editing or history navigation clears a pending substitution match preview.
- Unsupported command, range, destination, delimiter, argument, flag, register operand, invalid regex, too-large regex input, or zero-length regex match produces transient Ex error text.
- Unsupported range syntax includes repeated offsets such as `.+1-2`, repeated range separators, expression ranges, search addresses, mark addresses, `+cmd` suffixes, and broader Vimscript grammar.
- Successful mutating/editing commands show transient count text such as `2 substitutions`, `1 line deleted`, `3 lines moved`, or `2 lines transformed`.
- Valid read-only help/diagnostic commands open a bounded popup: `:help`, `:help <topic>`, `:features`, `:features <query>`, `:keybindings`, `:keybindings <query>`, `:actions`, `:actions <query>`, `:keymap`, `:keymap <action>`, `:mapcheck <key>`, `:messages`, `:changelog`, `:vimmode inspect`, and `:vimdoctor`.
- Popup-backed commands do not edit prompt text, registers, marks, search state, visual state, macros, or dot-repeat.
- Mutating command success/error feedback, parser errors, invalid command feedback, substitution preview/apply messages, `:noh`, prompt transforms, and optional no-op feedback stay in the compact Ex/workbench row.
- Compact success/error/info messages stay in the Ex row until the next handled input.
- `Ctrl-C` and `Ctrl-G` reset Vim transient state and delegate to Pi.
- Text-changing Ex commands clear visible prompt search highlights.
- Ex commands do not update dot-repeat. Only documented register operands on `:delete`, `:yank`, and `:put` touch named registers.
- Bare single-address line jumps such as `:3`, `:.`, `:$`, and offset forms like `:2+1` move the cursor to the addressed line without editing prompt text. Column is preserved when possible, clamped to target line length.
- Commandless ranges such as `:%`, `:2,4`, `:2;.+1`, and `:'<,'>` are unsupported and produce an Ex error without editing prompt text.
- Line jumps from visual Ex exit to normal mode, clear the visual selection, and move the cursor.

Transform examples:

```vim
:'<,'>quote
:2,4bulletize
:'<,'>fence ts
:reflow 72
```

Prompt transform actions can also be bound to normal/visual keys through `piVimMode.keymap.actions` using canonical `prompt.transform.*` IDs:

```json
{
  "piVimMode": {
    "keymap": {
      "actions": {
        "prompt.transform.reflow": ["gq", { "key": "gQ", "args": { "width": 100 } }],
        "prompt.transform.fence": ["gT"],
        "prompt.transform.quote": ["g>"],
        "prompt.transform.unquote": ["g<"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Action keybinding presets are opt-in bundles selected with `piVimMode.keymap.actionPresets`; recipes are copy-paste snippets for `piVimMode.keymap.actions`. Both are backed by the same finite canonical action metadata. They are not defaults, not recursive mappings, not runtime `:map`, not `.vimrc`, not plugin API, not diagnostic/help action dispatch, and not Vim/Neovim parity. Run `:features keybindings` or `:features action presets` to discover recommended presets and recipes at runtime.

<!-- runtime-help:keybinding-discovery-popup -->

### Read-only Ex popup and keybinding discovery

Valid read-only Ex help and diagnostic commands open a dedicated bounded read-only overlay popup, similar to Pi picker-style overlay UIs. Popup-backed commands include `:help`, `:help <topic>`, `:features`, `:features <query>`, `:features keybindings`, `:keybindings`, `:keybindings <query>`, `:actions`, `:actions <query>`, `:keymap`, `:keymap <action>`, `:mapcheck <key>`, `:messages`, `:changelog`, `:vimmode inspect`, and `:vimdoctor`.

## Which-key leader preview

`piVimMode.whichKey.enabled` is opt-in and defaults to `false`. When enabled, pressing a configured leader in Normal mode adds a bounded bordered panel below the editor without taking focus. The title is `WHICH-KEY`, or `WHICH-KEY : GROUP NAME` for the deepest configured prefix group. The row beneath it uses Pi's selected slash-autocomplete prefix/text styling for the typed suffix. The preview includes configured Normal-mode action bindings only, filters as keys continue, and collapses shared next-key prefixes. `piVimMode.whichKey.groups` labels a collapsed prefix adjacent to its key, such as `p  +workflow`; unnamed rows show the actual mapping count. Candidate leaves exactly use Pi's passive unselected slash-autocomplete layout and style. A `pi.command` leaf displays its slash command and uses the current Pi autocomplete provider's description in the aligned description column; a binding `desc` is the fallback. The titled panel border replaces the editor's normal lower border and the normal status bar sits directly below the last candidate or overflow row.

When the preview is enabled, `Backspace` steps up one complete key token. At the bare leader it stays open, and `Esc` uses normal pending-key cancellation. When disabled, Backspace keeps its existing resolver behavior. The preview has no delay, scrolling, built-in grammar hints, or non-leader hints. If a terminal cannot fit the minimal title, typed-key, and candidate/overflow panel while retaining four editor rows, the preview is suppressed.

`:keybindings` is the direct keybinding discovery entry point. It lists effective pi-vimmode bindings from resolved settings by finite category: commands, motions, operators, text objects, macros, marks, searches, prompt transform actions, and protected Pi shortcuts. Each binding row shows key, supported mode scope, action ID, and description in a fixed grid. `:keybindings <query>` shows focused detail for action IDs (`redo`, `wordForward`, `prompt.transform.reflow`), descriptions, current keys, protected shortcuts such as `ctrl+p`, rejected metadata/action binding warnings, and bounded no-match output. Ex commands and diagnostic/help metadata IDs are excluded from the catalog because they are not keybindings. It is read-only discovery: it does not edit settings, create mappings, run a command palette, or dispatch metadata actions.

`:features keybindings` remains supported as the recipe-oriented keybinding discovery entry point. That popup summarizes runtime help topics, feature discovery results, action keybinding recipes and presets, canonical `prompt.transform.*` action IDs, accepted configured bindings from `piVimMode.keymap.actions`, the `piVimMode.keymap.actionPresets` surface, customization diagnostics, message-history summaries, inspectability summaries, and hints for `:actions <query>`, `:keymap <action>`, `:keybindings <query>`, and `:mapcheck <key>`. Detailed setting shapes, defaults, and validation rules remain in [`settings.md`](https://github.com/pekochan069/pi-vimmode/blob/main/docs/settings.md).

When popup content overflows the bounded body, scroll inside the overlay with `j`/`k` or arrow-down/arrow-up to reach hidden rows. The popup scroll position is local overlay state only; it does not edit the prompt, move the prompt cursor, or append `:messages` history. Popup content, popup scroll, popup dismissal, and the output of `:messages` itself are not retained as runtime message history.

Dismiss the popup with `Esc`, `Ctrl-C`, or `Ctrl-G`. Mutating Ex commands, parser errors, edit-flow success/errors, prompt transforms, `:noh`, substitution preview/apply feedback, and optional no-op feedback keep compact inline/workbench behavior rather than opening the read-only popup.

Popup non-goals: no Vim help tags, no command palette, no runtime `:map`, no runtime `:action`, no recursive mappings, no Vimscript, no plugin API, no diagnostic/help action keybinding dispatch, no default action keybindings, no default keybinding for `:keybindings`, no persistent logs, and no unbounded output log.

<!-- action-keybinding-preset:paragraph-editing -->
<!-- action-keybinding-preset:markdown-wrapping -->

Preset IDs: `paragraph-editing`, `markdown-wrapping`.

Preset example:

```json
{
  "piVimMode": {
    "keymap": {
      "actionPresets": ["paragraph-editing", "markdown-wrapping"]
    }
  }
}
```

Explicit `piVimMode.keymap.actions` entries override preset-provided entries for the same action ID; explicit empty action arrays clear preset-provided entries.

<!-- action-keybinding-recipe:paragraph-editing -->

Paragraph editing recipe: `prompt.transform.reflow` on `gq`, `prompt.transform.quote` on `g>`, and `prompt.transform.unquote` on `g<`.

<!-- action-keybinding-recipe:markdown-wrapping -->

Markdown wrapping recipe: `prompt.transform.fence` on `gT` with no default language specifier, plus `prompt.transform.quote` on `g>` and `prompt.transform.unquote` on `g<`.

Examples:

```vim
g>    " quote current line
3gq   " reflow current line plus next two lines
gT    " fence current line with no language specifier
vjjg> " quote touched visual lines, then return to normal mode
```

Action keybindings call the same prompt transform behavior as Ex commands, but changed action edits are silent and do not update dot-repeat in this milestone. Visual actions use touched lines; visual-block action transforms are linewise, not rectangular. `piVimMode.promptTransforms.commands` remains the Ex command-name config surface. `piVimMode.promptTransforms.actions` remains the transform enable-flag surface. `piVimMode.keymap.actions` is only for key bindings.

Canonical config and diagnostic IDs are required: `prompt.transform.quote`, `prompt.transform.unquote`, `prompt.transform.bulletize`, `prompt.transform.fence`, `prompt.transform.indent`, `prompt.transform.dedent`, and `prompt.transform.reflow`. Non-canonical action IDs are rejected in config and do not match diagnostic/help searches.

Regex substitution bounds: pattern length 256, addressed prompt text length 50,000 UTF-16 code units, and match-count cap 10,000.

Limitations: no confirmation flag (`c`), print/list flags (`p`, `#`, `l`), special Ex registers, quoted Ex register operands such as `:delete \"a`, `:global`, shell/file/window/buffer commands, replacement backrefs, Vimscript evaluation, `.vimrc`, recursive mappings, Neovim Lua, full Vim help tags, a help pager, full interactive command palette, runtime `:map`, runtime `:action`, plugin API, quickref parity, or rectangular visual-block prompt transform actions. Transform command names are configurable through settings but do not add arbitrary Ex grammar.

### Runtime help and diagnostics

Runtime help is finite, popup-backed, source-backed, and prompt-local. It reports supported pi-vimmode behavior and limits; it does not read Vim help files or imply Vimscript/Neovim parity.

Examples:

```vim
:help             " entry points
:help search      " prompt search behavior and limits
:help ex          " finite Ex command-line behavior and limits
:features         " feature category summary
:features redo    " supported action and current binding
:features ctrl+p  " protected Pi shortcut ownership
:vimmode inspect  " current prompt-local editor state summary
:messages         " retained recent runtime message summary
```

`:actions` remains action-focused, `:keymap` remains binding-focused, `:mapcheck` explains one key or sequence, and `:vimdoctor` reports retained settings warnings behind `vim ⚠`. Use `:features` for broader feature/limit discovery. Diagnostic/help metadata IDs use the `vimmode.*` namespace for search and docs classification only; they are metadata-only, not bindable, and do not create a plugin action API.

`:vimmode inspect` is read-only and bounded. It summarizes mode, cursor, pending workbench state, selection kind/anchor, register slots/types/lengths, mark slots/positions, macro slots/token counts, search/Ex history counts, retained warning count, and render-layer activity. It does not dump full prompt text, full register contents, raw macro token streams, Vimscript state, or Neovim/runtime internals.

Runtime messages are in-memory for the current editor, bounded to 20 retained entries, and shown by `:messages` in the read-only popup. Popup display, popup scroll/dismissal, and `:messages` output itself do not add retained history entries. There is no message pager, persistent log, `:messages clear`, or full Vim `:messages` parity.

<!-- runtime-help:registers -->

## Registers

pi-vimmode supports one unnamed register, named edit registers `a-z`, and a finite subset of special registers, all in memory for the current editor session.

Behavior:

- Yank/delete/change update unnamed register by default.
- `""` explicitly targets the unnamed register for supported yank/delete/change/paste.
- `"{a-z}` targets next supported yank/delete/change/paste with named register.
- `"{A-Z}` appends yank/delete/change text to lowercase named register.
- Uppercase paste reads lowercase register.
- `"_` is a black-hole target: yank/delete/change discard captured text and preserve unnamed/named/clipboard registers; paste is a safe no-op.
- `"+` and `"*` write captured yank/delete/change text to Pi's host clipboard helper and a prompt-local typed clipboard mirror.
- `"+p`, `"+P`, `"*p`, and `"*P` read current host clipboard text for normal-mode paste, then fall back to the prompt-local typed clipboard mirror if host clipboard read fails.
- Host clipboard paste uses charwise paste semantics because OS clipboard text does not carry Vim linewise/charwise metadata; fallback mirror paste preserves typed register metadata.
- Ex line commands accept bare register operands: `:delete a`, `:yank +`, `:put *`, `:delete _`, `:delete "`. Quoted Ex operands such as `:yank "+` remain unsupported.
- Linewise registers paste below with `p` and above with `P`.
- Charwise registers paste after with `p` and before with `P`.
- Empty or missing register paste is a no-op.

Examples:

```text
"ayy   yank current line into register a and unnamed register
"ap    paste register a
"Ayy   append current line to register a
"bdw   delete word into register b
"_dd   delete current line without clobbering unnamed register
"+yy   yank current line to unnamed register, + mirror, and host clipboard
"*dw   delete word to unnamed register, * mirror, and host clipboard
""p    explicitly paste unnamed register
:yank +
:put *
```

Limitations: no full Vim/Neovim register parity; clipboard reads depend on platform clipboard tools (`pbpaste`, `win32yank.exe`/PowerShell on WSL/Windows, `wl-paste`, `xclip`, `xsel`, or Termux) and are only wired for normal-mode `"+p`/`"+P`/`"*p`/`"*P`; no numbered registers, yank register `"0`, small-delete register, expression register `"=`, or read-only filename/command/search registers such as `"%`, `":`, `".`, and `"/`.

<!-- runtime-help:marks -->

## Marks

Local marks `a-z` are stored in memory for the current editor session.

Behavior:

- `m{slot}` stores current cursor position.
- `` `{slot}`` jumps to exact stored line/column.
- `'{slot}` jumps to first non-blank column on stored line.
- Visual mark jumps preserve selection anchor and move active cursor/corner.
- Operators accept mark jumps as motions:
  - ``d`a`` deletes characterwise to exact mark.
  - `d'a` deletes linewise to marked line.
- Missing marks and invalid slots are safe no-ops.
- Stale marks are clamped to current prompt text.

Examples:

```text
ma      set mark a
`a      jump to exact mark a
'a      jump to marked line first non-blank
d'a     delete line range through mark a
```

Limitations: no global marks, special marks, automatic marks, mark list, persistence, or full Vim mark adjustment after edits.

<!-- runtime-help:macros -->

## Macros

Macros record and replay pi-vimmode input tokens in memory.

Behavior:

- `q{a-z}` starts recording a macro slot and replaces previous contents.
- Normal-mode `q` stops recording.
- Insert-mode `q` inserts and records literal `q`.
- `@{a-z}` plays a macro slot.
- `@@` repeats last successfully played macro.
- Ex command-line input, command text, `Enter`, and `Esc` are recorded and replayed.
- Playback is non-recursive; playback commands inside replay are ignored.
- Reset/submit keys (`Enter`, `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-G`), insert autocomplete-closing `Esc`, and delegated non-insert inputs are not recorded; insert-mode delegated keys outside those exceptions are recorded.
- Replay input count is capped by `piVimMode.macros.maxReplaySteps`.

Example:

```text
qa          start recording macro a
iTODO: Esc  insert text, return normal
q           stop recording
@a          replay macro a
@@          replay macro a again
```

Limitations: macros are in-memory only and separate from edit registers.

## UI, status, and cursor rendering

The editor renders a bordered prompt area and configurable status border.

Default status items:

- mode label: `INSERT`, `NORMAL`, `VISUAL`, `V-LINE`, `V-BLOCK`
- pending operator or prefix, e.g. `d…`, `g…`, `/query…`, `m…`, `:command…`
- visual selection summary and preview

Optional status item:

- cursor position, e.g. `12:4` or custom `L12:C4`

Rendering behavior:

- Status items are left-aligned by default; `piVimMode.ui.status.position: "right"` moves the complete ordered status group to the far-right border slot.
- Mode, pending state, selection, cursor position, and active macro recording (`REC {slot}`) always move together.
- Narrow widths use narrow labels: `I`, `N`, `V`, `VL`, `VB`, and truncate the aligned status group to fit.
- Visual selections are highlighted inline.
- Selected empty lines in visual line mode render a highlighted blank cell when width permits.
- Insert-mode autocomplete rows remain Pi-owned and visible; Vim status feedback renders on a separate row while completion UI is open.
- Pending `/`, `?`, and `:` workbench input plus search/Ex errors, info diagnostics, optional no-op feedback, and substitution match previews render in a dedicated row below the prompt and shrink prompt viewport by one row by default.
- `piVimMode.ui.workbench.reservedRows` can reserve 0-5 width-safe workbench rows; active feedback uses the first reserved row and blank reserved rows keep the prompt viewport height stable.
- Pending workbench input also appears in status with an ellipsis when the pending-status item is enabled.
- Long prompt content wraps and scrolls around cursor with `↑ more` / `↓ more` indicators; normal/visual mode transitions keep the current visible prompt rows stable while the cursor remains visible.
- Cursor styles support `block`, `bar`, and `underline` by mode.
- Terminal cursor-shape hints use best-effort DECSCUSR escapes.
- `bar` cursor enables Pi TUI hardware cursor visibility while interactive and while Pi agent work is active; non-bar cursors suppress hardware cursor visibility while busy. Reset restores original visibility.

Limitations:

- Search and cursor colors are fixed ANSI styles for now.
- Cursor behavior does not implement full Neovim cursor option parity such as blink timing.
- Unsupported terminals may ignore cursor-shape hints.
- Editing uses Pi cursor coordinates, not full grapheme-cluster Vim semantics. Complex Unicode can differ from Vim.

## Pi shortcut compatibility

Pi remains owner of app-level shortcuts.

- `Enter` submits from base prompt-editing modes when no `/` search or `:` Ex command-line is pending. Pending search uses Enter to complete the search; pending Ex uses Enter to execute the command.
- `Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-G`, `Ctrl-v`, `Alt-v`, `Ctrl-Alt-v`, model/thinking shortcuts, autocomplete controls, external editor shortcuts, and image paste stay Pi-owned unless a shortcut is explicitly implemented or explicitly bound by pi-vimmode.
- Protected Pi shortcut names are rejected from `piVimMode.keymap` with warnings that include the protected key reason. Use `:mapcheck <key>` for runtime ownership details.
- Protected key rejection can be explicitly overridden per settings layer through `piVimMode.keymap.allowProtectedOverrides`. See `docs/settings.md` for allow-list rules, scope, and limits.
- Overrides are not OS or terminal guarantees. pi-vimmode can only handle keys Pi delivers distinctly. Chorded shortcuts such as `ctrl+j` may arrive as `enter` depending on terminal configuration.
- `Ctrl-a`, `Ctrl-x`, and `Ctrl-r` are owned by pi-vimmode only in normal mode for numeric adjustment and redo.

<!-- runtime-help:settings -->

## Configuration features

Most keys map to semantic actions through `piVimMode.keymap`; settings do not add arbitrary Vim grammar. Optional `piVimMode.leader` and trusted `vim.g.mapleader` settings expand leading `<leader>` mapping keys with one final global/JS/project value. Advanced users can add trusted global JS keybindings in `~/.pi/agent/pi-vimmode.config.js` with `vim.keymap.set(mode, key, vim.prompt.<builtin>(args?))` or simple replay mappings such as `vim.keymap.set("n", "zz", "llll")`.

Examples of configurable features:

- startup mode
- cursor style per mode
- presets (`minimal`, `prompt-safe`, `vim-heavy`) that apply before explicit fields
- semantic key bindings for supported actions
- optional leader prefix for JSON and trusted JS normal/visual mappings
- trusted global JS keybinding additions via `vim.prompt.*` built-ins
- opt-in protected shortcut override list per settings layer
- text object kind/target keys
- allowed operator motions
- status item order
- mode labels and narrow labels
- visual preview width
- cursor position format/base
- macro enablement, slots, replay cap
- mark enablement and slots
- search highlight behavior
- prompt-native structure enablement per target
- prompt transform enablement and command names
- optional no-op feedback (`piVimMode.feedback.noop`) for selected confusing ignored inputs

See [`settings.md`](https://github.com/pekochan069/pi-vimmode/blob/main/docs/settings.md) for complete settings reference.

## Validate behavior

Automated checks:

```sh
bun test
bun run check-types
bun run lint
bun run format:check
```

Manual smoke checklist:

1. Load extension in Pi and confirm `pi-vimmode` status shows `vim`.
2. Type in insert mode, press `Esc`, move with normal motions.
3. Use `v`, `V`, and a configured visual-block binding such as `Alt-b`; confirm highlighting and yank/delete/change behavior.
4. Use `/query`, `n`, and `N`; confirm literal wraparound search and highlighting.
5. Use `:%s/old/new/g` and visual `:'<,'>s/old/new/`; confirm Ex row messages.
6. Use named registers, marks, and macros.
7. Submit from normal mode and start a new prompt; confirm configured startup mode behavior.
